# MPC Wear

MPC Wear is a [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/) client for Wear OS.

It connects your wearable device to a MPD server running in your local network over WiFi. You can control the daemon, browse your music collection and add music to the queue.

## Network connection

When a Wear OS device has a Bluetooth connection to a phone, the network traffic is proxied through the phone. It cannot access local network resources. Therefore MPC Wear connects to MPD over WiFi.

Please keep in mind that MPC Wear might not be able to connect to your MPD server if battery saver is turned on.

## Playstore

MPC Wear is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dixieflatline.mpcw).
